  email: String (unique index),
  password: String (bcrypt hashed),
  isPremium: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  // Future: emailVerified, phoneNumber, kycStatus
}
```

**Wallets Collection:**

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (indexed),
  balance: String (AES encrypted),
  totalCredited: String (AES encrypted),
  lastRechargeDate: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  // Future: currency, freezeStatus, dailyLimit
}
```

**Transactions Collection:**

  createdAt: Date (indexed),
  // Future: category, merchantId, paymentMethod
}
```

#### Indexing Strategy

**Performance Optimization:**

- Compound index on `userId + createdAt` for transaction queries
- Unique index on user email for fast authentication
- TTL index on session tokens for automatic cleanup

**Query Patterns:**

- User authentication: `db.users.findOne({email: "user@example.com"})`
- Wallet balance: `db.wallets.findOne({userId: ObjectId})`
- Transaction history: `db.transactions.find({userId: ObjectId}).sort({createdAt: -1})`

### 2.2 Security Implementation

#### Authentication Flow

**JWT Token Structure:**

```javascript
{
  userId: "user_object_id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "User Name",
  isPremium: boolean,
  iat: timestamp,
  exp: timestamp
}
```

**Password Security:**

- bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- Password reset via secure email tokens (future enhancement)

#### Data Encryption

**Encryption Implementation:**

```javascript
// Encryption utility
export function encryptBalance(balance) {
  return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(balance.toString(), SECRET_KEY).toString();
}

// Decryption utility
export function decryptBalance(encryptedBalance) {
  const bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedBalance, SECRET_KEY);
  return parseFloat(bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));
}
```

**Key Management:**

- Environment variables for encryption keys
- Key rotation strategy (manual for MVP, automated for production)

### 2.4 MongoDB Integration Patterns

#### Connection Management

**Connection Pooling:**

```javascript
// Singleton pattern for MongoDB connection
let client;
let clientPromise;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  if (!global._mongoClientPromise) {
    client = new MongoClient(uri, options);
    global._mongoClientPromise = client.connect();
  }
  clientPromise = global._mongoClientPromise;
} else {
  client = new MongoClient(uri, options);
  clientPromise = client.connect();
}
```

#### Transaction Handling

**ACID Compliance:**

```javascript
const session = client.startSession()
await session.withTransaction(async () => {
  // Update wallet balance
  await db.collection('wallets').updateOne({...}, {...}, {session})
  // Create transaction record
  await db.collection('transactions').insertOne({...}, {session})
})
```

**Consistency Guarantees:**

- Read/write concerns configured for strong consistency
